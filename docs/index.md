# VizAR: The Proof Navigator

**VizAR** is a system for the visualization of proofs originating from
_Automated Theorem Provers_ (ATP) for first-order logic. The system can hide
uninteresting parts of proofs, such as type annotations, translate first-order
terms to standard math syntax, and compactly display complex formulas. 

⚠️  If you are new to VizAR then kindly **[check the
Introduction](intro.html)** before you continue. ⚠️

In the [Proofs](proofs) section you can see the system demonstrated on several
non-trivial ATP proofs of statements from _Mizar Mathematical Library_
translated to first-order logic and proved by E Prover.

### Feedback

of VizAR then [check the Feedback section](feedback.html).
