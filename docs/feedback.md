### VizAR syntax for Mizar symbols

If you have a suggestion for a special VizAR syntax of some Mizar symbols, we would love to hear about it.
Please send it to us in [this discussion topic](https://github.com/ai4reason/vizar/discussions/1).
Check the information at the top of that page.
You can simply submit a single line in the following format:

```
m2_subset_1   ###1 ∈ ###3 ⊆ ###2
```

Specific instructions can be provided on demand.
